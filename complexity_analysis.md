# Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity / Space Complexity (if it matters)

## Day 1

Part 1: O(n)

Part 2: O(n)

where n is number of numbers

## Day 2

Part 1: O(n)

Part 2: O(n)

where n is number of commands

## Day 3

Part 1: O(LB)

Part 2: O(LB)

where L is number of lines, B is numbers of bits (string length)

## Day 4

Part 1 & 2: O(NBS²)

where N is length of Bingo Numbers, B is number of Bingo Tables, S is width of Bingo Table

## Day 5

Part 1: O(LS²) / O(S²)

Part 2: O(LS²) / O(S²)

where L is number of lines, S is width of the grid
