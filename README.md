# Advent Of Code 2021

My Code for Advent of Code 2021

Participate because everyone do

Written in C++ because C++ is the best language for problem solving

Note: I use

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
```

because it is what competitive programmers do

Surely not to use it on production
